# BP_TRACKER - Blood Pressure Monitoring App

## Introduction

**BP_TRACKER** is a comprehensive web-based application designed to help users monitor and track their blood pressure levels. With features such as user authentication, input of blood pressure data, graphical representations of blood pressure trends over time, and health status analysis, this app provides a simple and effective way for users to maintain their cardiovascular health.

Users can log in, view past records, track trends, and receive real-time feedback on whether their blood pressure is high, low, or normal. The application is built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and uses modern web technologies for an intuitive and responsive experience.
